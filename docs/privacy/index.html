  <h1>Privacy Policy – AUFAIT Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)</h1>
  <p><strong>AUFAIT Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)</strong> is a SharePoint-based solution by <strong>Aufait</strong>. This policy explains how the ERM app handles personal information.</p>

  <h2>Scope</h2>
  <p>This policy applies to the <strong>AUFAIT Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)</strong> app and its operation within Microsoft 365 (SharePoint Online, Power Automate). It does not cover unrelated areas of our website or services.</p>

  <h2>Data the App Processes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User profile data</strong> (e.g., name, email, department) shown in SharePoint columns and used in approval/notification workflows.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk records and related content</strong> you create in SharePoint lists and libraries (e.g., Risk Details, Mitigation/Contingency Plans, Approval Logs).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where Data Is Stored</h2>
  <p>All app data is stored within your organization’s Microsoft 365 tenant (SharePoint Online/Power Automate). <strong>No data is transmitted to Aufait servers</strong> or third-party services by the app.</p>

  <h2>Authentication & Access</h2>
  <p>The app uses Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) for authentication. Access to data is governed by your SharePoint site permissions and role configuration defined by your administrators.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Personal Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To display user names/emails in risk ownership, approvals, and notifications.</li>
    <li>To support audit history and routing in Power Automate flows (e.g., reminders/escalations).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p><strong>We do not sell or share</strong> personal information processed by the ERM app with third parties. Data remains within your Microsoft 365 environment unless your organization exports it.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
  <p>Retention is controlled by your organization. Admins can delete list items, files, or disable the app at any time. Removing the app does not automatically remove data stored in SharePoint lists/libraries—your admins manage lifecycle as per your policies.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>The app operates within Microsoft 365 and inherits platform security controls (encryption, access control, auditing). We recommend limiting access via SharePoint permissions and regularly reviewing Power Automate connections.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Requests to access, correct, or delete data should be made to your organization’s Microsoft 365/SharePoint administrator, who controls app data.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Data</h2>
  <p>The app is intended for enterprise use and is not directed to children.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions about this policy or the AUFAIT ERM app, contact: <a href="mailto:support@aufaittechnologies.com">support@aufaittechnologies.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy to reflect app or regulatory changes. The “Last Updated” date indicates the most recent revision.</p>

  <p><em>Last Updated: October 2025</em></p>
